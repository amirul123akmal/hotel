1.You need to download XAMPP for windows

2.Run Apache and MySql

3.Paste all the code in xampp/htdocs/(your folder name)

4.Go to web browser and type "localhost/(your folder name)"

However , the databases is still with me

It just i dont know how to Export the Database for other people to use

so it will be no use

It will run your index.php first
